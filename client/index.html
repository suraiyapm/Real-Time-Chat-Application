            <p>I think the tricky parts (challenges faces) included just the process convenience things.
                In our group project (MedSift) I believe it's Vite that we are using that adds sort of convenience
                and workflow features, like the easy r and o for restarting and opening the running server stuff.
                Here, I did some Google-ing before realizing that, at least, setting up the npm script to run the server
                with the short terminal command was pretty simple! That was an interesting one to figure out, since
                I didn't realize it was so simple before (my npm run dev script).
                <br/><br/><br/>
                Besides that, there isn't a lot I could think of besides a little bug fixing near the end where something
                wasn't working as expected. Once it all functions as normal, though, design can be sort of fun to
                experiment with!
