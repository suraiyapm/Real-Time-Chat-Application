            <p class="info">I think the tricky parts (challenges faces) included just the process convenience things.
                In our group project (MedSift) I believe it's Vite that we are using that adds sort of convenience
                and workflow features, like the easy r and o for restarting and opening the running server stuff.
                Here, I did some Google-ing before realizing that, at least, setting up the npm script to run the server
                with the short terminal command was pretty simple! That was an interesting one to figure out, since
                I didn't realize it was so simple before (my npm run dev script).
                <br /><br />
                Besides that, there isn't a lot I could think of besides a little bug fixing near the end where
                something
                wasn't working as expected. Once it all functions as normal, though, design can be sort of fun to
                experiment with!
                <br />
                One random other fun little challenge was figuring out that browser default margin little bit at the
                top.
                To have there be no gap in my css with the #left being 100vh (gap was showing at the top), I had to make
                body margin 0, even though no buffer was specified by me, myself.

        <div id="chatroom-shiz">
            <div id="container-note"></div>
            <form id="container-send">
                <input type="text" id="inputNote">
                <button type="submit" id="button-send">Fly, Pigeon!</button>
            </form>
        </div>
        <div id="right">
            <p class="info">Another thing was getting the layout right (how I wanted it). To achieve this,
                I messed with the sizing and flex and all that, it was a bit fun.
                <br /><br />
                Oh, also. I gave a bunch of my elements really stupid names.
                This resulted in my repeatedly losing track of what exactly each one was,
                and what I was changing in the css (and actual code stuff before styling).
                This was dumb. I will try not to do that again.
